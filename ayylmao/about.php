            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our goal and mission is to give each one of our prospects the best instruction and training so that they can perform at their peak baseball abilities. Our elite trainers and coaches, along with our top of the line recruiting website, will give every prospect the ability to showcase their skills in front of coaches and scouts across the country.</p>

            <p>Hard work, determination, and skill development will be key attributes for each prospect to find success not only on the diamond but in life. Each prospect will have the ability to sit down with the coaches and trainers to set specific, realistic goals, and to figure out the most direct way to accomplish them. Our goal is to not only use baseball to help supplement a college education, but to challenge each prospect to meet the goal that they set out to accomplish.</p>
